        text("In this world...")

    episode("Ep 2 - Unexpected Encounters")
        text("Hi there. Kizuna's voice chimed, the sound like a melodic echo in the tranquil surroundings. Their eyes met, and in that instant, a bond began to form.")
        choice("I love you Kizuna", "Reject Kizuna", "Be my girlfriend", "We break up", "Ignore Kizuna") => ("love_dialogue_1", "rejection", "love_dialogue_2", "end", "move")
